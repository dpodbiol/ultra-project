			<p>Ultracomida has spent 10 years researching & sourcing foods from small producers in spain for our delicatessens and restaurants based in West Wales. we have tried and tested a whole heap of products and can now offer you the best of our Spanish lines, imported by us and delivered direct to your door. Our range includes everything from exclusive extra virgin olive oil from Priorat to Queso Manchego from La Mancha, from Jamon Iberico de Bellota to exciting new wines from the Ribera del Duero, all selected with care from small, artisan producers and made to the highest standard. So now a larder full of Spanish goodies and last minute tapas ideas is just a click away.</p>

			<p><strong>Spanish Food and Wine on the High Street</strong></p>
			<p>Both of our outlets offer a wonderful selection of food & drink to go available from the moment we open.  Our fair-trade coffee (100% Arabica) from a Spanish/Nicaraguan co-operative gives a rich and balanced espresso or cafe con leche, but our most popular drink by far is the traditional, thick Spanish drinking chocolate which is excellent for cold winter mornings and as a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.  If you're feeling hungry then we can offer you a range of hot panini (filled with our ingredients on the premises), freshly made barra gallegas (crusty, Spanish baguette) using meats and cheeses from the deli or the classic tortilla espanola (Spanish potato & sweet onion omelette). You can also choose from a range of tapas on offer.</p>

			<p>When you have more time to spare why not take a look at our restaurants (both are listed in the Good Food Guide 2009/10) which are located behind the shop in Aberystwyth and in Narberth.  During the day we serve a range of tapas mixed with our deli based options (charcuterie plate, cheeseboard, plato de la casa..) some classic bistro dishes (Lyonnaise salad, Tartiflette, Warm goat's cheese salad) which are available until 4.30, and a 2/3course set menu available between 12 -2.30.  On Fridays (and now Saturdays) we extend the daytime tapas menu until 5pm and then switch to an evening menu at 7pm which is available until 9pm.  The continental design of our restaurants centre on our large shared tables and bar space which were designed and built for us by a local carpenter.  Both of our restaurants are available for group bookings any night of the week.</p>
