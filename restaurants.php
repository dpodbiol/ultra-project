			<blockquote>Thanks to Ultracomida for the best party ever! Beautiful, fresh tapas, the croquetas were fab and as for the paella....LUSH! The staff were incredibly accommodating and friendly. Some lovely wines were chosen and enjoyed, and a great night was had by all.</blockquote> - Raquel Gonzalez 
			<blockquote>We'd planned just to have a quick drink but the tapas menu was irresistible. I had a delicious squid salad and every dish produced for my friends and the people we were sharing a huge table with looked mouth-wateringly fresh and inviting.  I wish I'd been more hungry and could have tried more dishes!</blockquote> - Tripadvisor review
