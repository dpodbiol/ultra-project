			<h2>about us</h2>
			<img src="images/about.jpg" alt="spanish_products" />
			
			<p>With family connections in Spain, my mother comes from a small village in the mountains of Valencia , I’ve always felt a pull or a sense of belonging to the country, and I especially loved the artisan nature of the food and the pride that goes into producing the wonderful food and drink that comes from Spain.
			</p>
			<p>Over the past decade, me and my wife, Shumana have spent over 10 years travelling extensively around Spain making contact with producers across the mainland. 
			</p>
			<p>Our dream of opening up a Spanish delicatessen and restaurant, bringing artisan Spanish food to the high street, came true when we opened the doors to our first deli in Aberystwyth in August 2001 .
			</p>
			<p>11 years on we’ve moved premises in Aberystwyth to a larger establishment, a stone’s throw from the beach and opened another deli in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, Shumana’s home town. 
			</p>
			<p>Our ethos is to bring quality and artisan Spanish produce to our customers ensuring the utmost quality and provenance. We never sell or serve a thing that has not been tested by us. We do the tastings, we do the importing and you get to do the eating. Our range includes everything from exclusive extra virgin olive oil from Priorat to Queso Manchego from La Mancha, from Jamon Iberico de Bellota to exciting new wines from the Ribera del Duero, all selected with care from small, artisan producers and made to the highest standard. 
			</p>
			<p>With growing feedback from kind customers, especially visitors to Aberystwyth and Narberth, we had numerous requests for a delivery service allowing customers across the UK the chance to stock up their larders with quality Spanish food. So the logical next step for us was setting up the online ultracomida shop getting Spanish produce to our customers, old and new, across the UK within 48 hours.
			</p>
			<p>We’ve won a couple of awards along the way (see below) and nice write ups in the press but we firmly believe that it’s the quality of the food and the level of service that does the talking and that our passion for food keeps us going.
			</p>
			<p>So that’s our story so far, 
			</p>
