				  <li>These are the terms and conditions which apply to all transactions through this website between you, the customer, and us, Ultracomida Trading Co Ltd, trading as Ultracomida Online, registration number 07239212, VAT number 994365960, registered in England and Wales.</li>
					<li>When you place an order, we will send you an email to acknowledge that we have received your order. This email does not constitute acceptance of your order. We will need to verify your payment details and process your order. We will send you an email notifying you that the goods have been despatched. This will constitute our acceptance of your offer to buy, and a binding contract will be formed at that point.</li>
					<li>Goods are subject to availability. Publication on this website does not constitute an offer for sale.</li>
					<li>All our products are artesan-produced. Meat and cheese curing and portioning can result in varying weights and sizes. Weights given on the website are an approximate guide only.</li>
					<li>The prices shown are for the goods only and do not include delivery charges. These will be added to your total during the ordering process. Where VAT is payable, it is included in the price of the product. We are currently only accepting orders from within mainland UK. (See our delivery policy for more details on delivery charges, included at the end of these terms and conditions for your convenience.)</li>
					<li>We do our best to ensure that all prices on our website are accurate. However, if it should be discovered that there is an error in the price of the goods you have ordered, we will contact you as soon as possible. You have the option at that point of either continuing with your order at the amended price, or of cancelling the order. If ever your card is charged in error, we will refund your money promptly.</li>
					<li>We aim to despatch all orders within 2 working days. If we are unable to despatch your order within 7 days, we will contact you with an estimated despatch date, and give you a choice of cancelling your order at that point.</li>
					<li>We cannot be held responsible for the condition of the goods if no one was at the delivery address, and the goods could not be delivered. You are responsible for ensuring that delivery address details are correct, and that you have provided the correct postcode. Please see our delivery policy for further details on delivery.</li>
					<li>AGE RESTRICTED PRODUCTS – Our wines, beers and spirits are only sold to customers over the age of 18. By placing an order, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. If you are buying alcohol as a gift, the recipient must be over 18 as well, and by placing an order, you confirm this fact. We may refuse an order at our discretion if we have concerns about the age of the buyer or the recipient.</li>
					<li>Cancellation Policy – If you wish to cancel your order, you will need to contact us by phone or by email. Please see the contacts page for these details. In the aims of good service, we process orders as quickly as possible, and may not be able to stop an order
					from being despatched. If your order has already been despatched, you may return the items to us in accordance with our Returns policy (see below).</li>
					<li>Returns Policy - Returns are accepted only if the goods are damaged. You must contact us no more than 24 hours after receipt. You will need to return the item in its original, complete packaging. If the item has not been returned to us in its original condition, we may refuse to accept the return. The original delivery documents will also need to accompany the goods, along with a receipt for the postage paid for returning the goods, if we are to issue a refund. Please see our contacts page for details on how to contact us.
					These terms do not affect your statutory rights as a consumer, or your right to return non-perishable goods under the Distance Selling Regulations. For non-perishable goods, you have a right to return them during the cooling-off period of 7 days, regardless of the condition of the goods. You will still need to follow the above requirements of returning the item in its original, complete packaging.</li>
					<li>All confidential information, including credit card details, is held securely and is only transmitted in encrypted form. Customer details are not passed to third parties and are used only in accordance with the Data Protection Act.</li>
					<li>1We will not be responsible to you or any third party for any business loss (including loss of revenue, profits, contracts, anticipated savings, wasted expenditure, data or goodwill) or any other loss or damage which does not result directly from our actions or the actions of our sub-contractors or suppliers, is consequential, or was not reasonably foreseeable to both you and us when the contract between us was formed.
					Our liability to you under these terms and conditions will not exceed the total price charged for the items purchased.</li>
					<li>These terms and conditions are governed by the law of England and Wales. The parties to the contract agree to submit any dispute that arises from this agreement to the courts of England and Wales.</li>
					<li>We reserve the right to make changes at any time to this website, these terms and conditions, our privacy policy and any other such policies of which we may inform you.</li>
					<li>Delivery Policy
					We use a courier service to send your goods to you. For mainland England, Wales and the Lowlands of Scotland, it is a next working day delivery service. (For most of the Highlands of Scotland and for non-mainland UK, it is a minimum two-day service. Our packaging is designed for 24-hr delivery so on refrigerated goods we cannot guarantee that they will still be in optimum condition after two days in transit. We would suggest therefore that customers in this area choose from the non-perishable selections.) See table below for prices.
					Our service does not require a signature to acknowledge delivery. A box is provided during the checkout process where you can tell us where to leave the goods if no-one is in at the time of delivery. If this information has not been provided, and the driver is unable to deliver the goods or if anything happens to the goods in the time it takes you to collect them from your safe place, we cannot be held responsible for the condition of the goods.
					You are responsible for ensuring that the delivery address details are correct, and that you have provided the correct postcode.
					Delivery is only on working days, therefore orders are usually despatched Monday – Thursday (Mon-Weds for the Highlands of Scotland), as we do not want refrigerated goods to sit in our courier’s warehouse over the weekend.
					Maximum delivery weight is 40kg.
